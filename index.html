        <p><br>Telecom fraud targeting the elderly can have severe consequences.
<br> Here are some detailed cases:
<br><br><h3 style="color:Aquamarine;">1. Bank Impersonation Scam: </h3>
<br>In Jiangsu, China, a con artist posing as a bank employee offered free gifts to entice over a thousand elderly individuals to purchase a so called  "Seahorse Life Magnetic Fiber Quilt," claiming it could cure ailments like high blood pressure and cervical spondylosis, and even eliminate cancer cells. This elaborate scam involved 46 defendants and unlawfully profited by 3.79 million yuan, impacting 1,600 elderly victims.
<div>
        <img src="图片四.jpg" alt="诈骗案例图四" style="width: 25%; height: 25%;">
      </div>
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">2. Fake Investment Scam: </h3>
<br><br>In a county, four men driving luxury cars targeted rural elderly people, claiming to need cash for a senior official's birthday and exchanging counterfeit money for real money. They scammed tens of thousands of yuan from multiple victims.
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">3. Health Product Scam: </h3>
<br><br>Mr. Li's wife was convinced by an advertisement for health supplements. Without informing Mr. Li or their children, she spent thousands of yuan over three months on products that had no medicinal value.
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">4. Lottery Scam: </h3>
<br><br>Mrs. Ma, living in the suburbs, received a letter containing a scratch-off card and a notarized document from a company. To her surprise, she had won a 2 million yuan prize. Excited, she called the number on the card to claim her prize and was instructed to transfer money for various fees. She ended up losing 160,000 yuan to the scam.
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">5. Product promotion fraud: </h3>
<br><br>To apply for free water purifiers as a gimmick, targeting the elderly in rural areas in the outer suburbs of Beijing to implement fraud
<br><br>Uncle Li, who lives in Shunyi, Beijing, is over 70 years old. Not long ago, while taking a walk, he met two strange men who claimed that they would give away water purifiers for free, but the only condition was that Uncle Li had to attend a health lecture. The health talk was arranged to be held in a hotel and gathered more than 20 elderly people. During the lecture, the lecturer repeatedly emphasized the benefits of water purifiers through videos, insisting that long-term drinking can prevent many diseases, including diabetes. At first, many older people were skeptical. But the lecturer himself carried out a convincing experiment: the lecturer poured the ink into the transparent tap water, after the filter of the water purifier, the black ink turned into clear and transparent water, and <br>he did not hesitate to drink a mouthful. This scene made the old people present completely believe in the magic effect of the water purifier.
<br>The lecturer explained that the water purifier is free, but you need to buy 18 filter elements, a total of 5,940 yuan. Uncle Li was fooled by this routine, paid the money to go home after a try, only to find that he was cheated. After the police investigation, they found that the criminal gang cost only 325 yuan per water purifier, including 18 filter elements. What seemed like a magical experiment was just a chemical hoax.
<br><br>According to the city's 110 police combing results, this kind of fraud is mainly concentrated in Daxing, Changping, Shunyi, Pinggu, Miyun, Yanqing and other rural areas. The victims, most of whom were over 60 years old, were cheated of amounts ranging from 2,000 yuan to 5,940 yuan.

      <h2 style="color: DodgerBlue;">Internet Fraud</h2>
        <p><br><h3 style="color:DeepSkyBlue;">Case 1: Fake health products promotion</h3>
<br>“Dear uncle/aunt, this newly developed health product of ours is specially designed to target common health problems among the elderly, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and joint pain, and it has miraculous effects. Many elderly people like you have said that their health has improved and they have more energy after taking it. It is a high-tech product made with rare natural ingredients and is generally not available on the market. Now we are having a promotional activity, and the price is extremely favorable. If you miss this opportunity, it will be a pity when it returns to the original price later.”
<br><br><h3 style="color:DeepSkyBlue;">Case 2: Impersonating public security law fraud</h3>
<br><br>“Hello, is this [elderly person's name]? I am a staff member of [a certain public security bureau/procuratorate/court name]. Your identity information is suspected of being involved in a major economic crime case. Now we need you to cooperate with our investigation. Don't tell anyone to avoid alerting the suspects. You need to temporarily transfer the funds in your bank account to the safe account we designate for review, and it will be returned to you immediately after the review. If you don't cooperate, you will face serious legal consequences.”
<br>Details of the case: the fraudster impersonates the staff of the public prosecutor's office, contacts the elderly through the phone or the Internet, fabricates the lie that the elderly are involved in the case, uses the elderly's awe of the legal authority, puts them into panic, and then transfers their savings to the so-called "security account" according to the instructions of the fraudsters, ultimately leading to property losses.
 <br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">Case 3: Pension fraud with housing</h3>
<br><br>“Uncle/aunt, do you know there is a new type of pension model called'reverse mortgage for the elderly'? That is, you mortgage your house, and then our company will give you a large sum of money. You can use this money to enjoy a high-quality life in your old age, and you can still live in the house. There will also be additional income every month, which is much more cost-effective than leaving the house empty or renting it out by yourself. This is a project strongly supported by the state, and many elderly people have already participated. You can rest assured.”
<br>Case details: In the name of "housing for the elderly", the scammer tricked the elderly into mortgaging their real estate to some illegal institutions. These institutions often charge high fees and other fees, and then disappear or leave the elderly in debt, resulting in the elderly not only losing their homes, but also facing financial crisis.
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">Case 4: Free tourist trap fraud</h3>
<br><br>Dear uncle/aunt, our travel agency is currently holding a free travel activity, and the destination is a very beautiful [travel place]. During the journey, we will also arrange health lectures and free medical examination services. This is a rare opportunity to enjoy the beautiful scenery and also pay attention to your health. There are limited places. If you are interested, sign up quickly.”
<br>Case details: Fraud gangs use free travel as a lure to attract elderly people to sign up. In the process of travel, money is obtained from the elderly through forced shopping, selling high-priced and low-quality goods, or charging extra fees for various reasons. Some elderly people may suffer financial losses because they do not want to spoil the trip or are forced to buy a lot of unnecessary things under pressure.
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">Case 5: Investment financial fraud</h3>
<br><br>“Aunt/uncle, our company has launched a brand-new investment and financial management project with an extremely high return rate, several times higher than the interest of bank deposits. The risk is extremely low. We have a professional team for management and operation, and many customers have already obtained substantial earnings. You see, you also have some spare money. If you invest it with us, it will quickly increase the value of your wealth and provide more security for your old age.”
<br>Case details: Fraudsters fabricate high-return, low-risk investment and financing projects to attract elderly people who lack financial knowledge. They usually give some small returns to gain the trust of the elderly, and then induce the elderly to invest more money, and finally flee with the money, so that the elderly have no return.
<div><img src="图片三.jpg" alt="诈骗案例图三" style="width: 25%; height: 25%;"></div>
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">1. Independent Verification</h3>
<br><br>To confirm the identity of the other person, rely on official channels, trusted relatives, or close acquaintances. Avoid depending on information or documentation provided solely by the person claiming the identity, as it could be falsified. For example, if someone contacts you claiming to represent a bank, independently verify their claims by calling the bank's official customer service line rather than responding to the contact details they provide. Similarly, if a person claims to know your family, reach out to a family member to confirm the relationship. By cross-checking information from reliable and independent sources, you reduce the risk of falling victim to deception or fraud.
<br><br><h3 style="color:DeepSkyBlue;">2. Stop communicating with them immediately</h3>
<br><br>If you are unable to verify the identity of the person you are interacting with, or if their behavior raises any red flags, it is crucial to prioritize your safety and security. Suspicious actions might include avoiding direct answers, pressuring you to make quick decisions, or providing inconsistent information. In such cases, do not hesitate to end the interaction. Politely but firmly stop responding and terminate the call, message exchange, or conversation immediately. Continuing the interaction could expose you to risks such as scams, identity theft, or emotional manipulation. Remember, it is better to err on the side of caution and reassess the situation later than to remain engaged in a potentially harmful encounter. Trust your instincts and prioritize seeking assistance from trusted sources or authorities if necessary.
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">3. Preservation of evidence</h3>
<br><br>Make sure to keep a detailed record of all interactions, including chat logs, messages, emails, transfer receipts, and any other relevant documentation. These records serve multiple important purposes. First, they provide evidence in case you need to report the situation to authorities, financial institutions, or other organizations for investigation or resolution. Second, they allow you to review the details of the interaction, which can help identify inconsistencies or confirm suspicions.
Be meticulous about saving the information—take screenshots of conversations, download and securely store digital files, and ensure that any physical documents are kept in a safe place. If possible, back up these records in multiple locations, such as a secure cloud storage service and a local device, to prevent accidental loss. Organized and accessible documentation can be invaluable if you need to dispute transactions, verify claims, or pursue legal action in the future.
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">4. Call 110</h3>
<br><br>If you suspect that you have been cheated or become a victim of fraud, it is important to promptly report the situation to the authorities and follow their guidance. Begin by calmly briefing the police or relevant law enforcement officials on the details of the incident. Provide a clear and concise account of what happened, including the timeline, the method of contact, the nature of the scam, and any promises or demands made by the other party. Share any supporting evidence you have, such as chat logs, transaction receipts, or screenshots, to help them understand the case and investigate effectively.
Once you have reported the incident, carefully follow the instructions provided by the police. This may involve refraining from further contact with the suspected fraudster, securing your financial accounts, or providing additional documentation. Cooperating fully with their investigation increases the chances of resolving the case and may help protect others from similar scams. Stay patient and composed throughout the process, as investigations may take time. Your prompt action and cooperation can make a significant difference in addressing the issue.
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">5. Contact Anti-Fraud Centre (96110)</h3>
<br><br>When working to recover funds after a fraudulent incident, providing detailed and accurate information is critical to support the recovery process. Gather and organize all relevant documentation, leaving no detail overlooked.
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">6. Tell family and friends and report it</h3>
<br><br>If you suspect that you have been cheated, reach out to trusted relatives and friends for support and assistance in verifying the situation. Share the details of the incident with them, including any evidence or suspicious interactions, to get a second opinion and identify potential red flags you may have missed. Friends or family members may have relevant experience or knowledge that can help clarify the situation and guide your next steps.
Once you have confirmed or strongly suspect fraudulent activity, take immediate action by formally reporting the case to the appropriate public security organ or local police station. Provide them with a thorough account of the incident, including a timeline of events, any suspicious behavior, and all supporting documents such as chat records, transaction receipts, and screenshots. The sooner you report, the higher the chances of preventing further losses or tracing the perpetrators.
Additionally, inform the authorities about any steps you have already taken, such as freezing accounts or contacting financial institutions. Be prepared to cooperate fully with the investigation, answering questions and supplying further evidence if needed. Seeking the help of relatives and friends not only provides emotional support but also ensures you approach the reporting process with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the situation

  <a href=" https://v.douyin.com/CeiwJhLx/">Listen to Sa Beining teach you to stay away from fraud.</a>
      <p><p>Basic fraud prevention tips and cases
<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">1. Stay alert </h3>
<br><br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Cold calls or messages</h4>
<br>Do not trust strangers claiming to be police, bank customer service, etc., to provide personal information or transfer money.
<br>Case: Mr. Zhang received a phone call from a bank customer who falsely claimed that his account was frozen and asked for a verification code to unfreeze it. Mr. Zhang refused to provide and called the official customer service phone to verify, to avoid losses.

<br><br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Unknown link</h4>
<br>Do not click on links in unexplained text messages or emails, especially those claiming "abnormal order" or "account risk".
Case: Ms. Li received an abnormal express message, including a link. After she called the official phone number of the Courier, she learned that it was fraud information, did not click the link, and protected her information.

<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">2. Protect personal information</h3>  
<br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Don't disclose information at will</h4>
<br>Including ID number, bank card number, password and verification code, unless the identity of the other party is confirmed through official channels.
<br>Case: Mr. Wang received a text message saying that his social security account was abnormal and he needed to provide his ID number and social security password. He went directly to the Social Security Bureau for consultation to confirm that the information was correct and avoid being cheated.

<br><br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Dual verification</h4>
<br>Important information such as account changes, loan applications, etc., need to be verified again through the official customer service phone or offline outlets.
<br>Case in point: Xiao Zhao received a "bank notice" that she had a large charge on her credit card and needed to pay the outstanding payment immediately. Xiaozhao called the bank's official customer service phone, found that the credit card is not abnormal.

<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">3. Identify common scams</h3>
<br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Impersonating customer service</h4>  
<br>Scammers may impersonate bank or e-commerce platform customer service, falsely claiming that the account abnormally needs to transfer funds or provide verification codes.
<br>Case: Miss Lin received a call from "a platform customer service" asking for a transfer to solve the account problem. She hung up and contacted official customer service to confirm that the caller was a scammer.

<br><br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Lottery scam</h4>  
<br>Claim you've won a huge prize, but pay fees or taxes.
<br>Case: Mr. Zhao received a "winning notice" that he had won a car, but had to pay the transportation fee first. He failed to pay and called the police, avoiding financial loss.

<br><br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Emotional fraud </h4> 
<br>After establishing trust through social networks, ask for money.
<br>Case in point: A scammer contacted Xiao Fang through social media and later lied that he needed urgent money abroad. Xiao Fang found the anomaly after the termination of contact.

<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">4. Use technical protection</h3>
<br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Enable fraud alerts </h4>
<br>Install an officially recommended anti-fraud app or your phone's harassment blocker.
<br>Case: Mr. Chen enabled anti-fraud alerts on his mobile phone and successfully intercepted a phishing text message.

<br><br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Security software</h4>
<br>Update the antivirus software and firewall regularly.
<br>Case in point: Xiao Li installed anti-virus software, and when he tried to access a phishing website, the software immediately issued a warning and blocked access.

<br><br><h3 style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">5. Financial and investment considerations</h3>
<br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">High return promise</h4>
<br>Be wary of investments that claim "zero risk, high return."
<br>Case: Aunt Zhang heard that the annual rate of return of a platform was as high as 30%, but after checking it, she found that the platform was not registered as a legitimate financial institution and avoided being cheated.

<br><br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Verify qualification</h4>
<br>Before investment, check the platform's business license, financial license and other qualifications.
<br>Case: Before investing, Mr. Liu logged on to the official website of China Securities Regulatory Commission to check the platform qualification, and then invested money after confirming the legality.

<br><br>Summary: Do not listen, do not believe, do not transfer, more confirmation, more prevention of a risk, less a loss!

  <h1 style="color:MidnightBlue;">Help and Report</h1>
  <p><br><h3 style="color:DeepSkyBlue;">1. Try to verify the other person's identity</h3>
<br><br><h4 style="color: LightSkyBlue;">Calm Analysis</h4>
<br><br>When faced with a situation where the identity or claims of another person are in question, it's essential to remain calm and approach the matter analytically. Begin by asking questions that only someone close to you or a trusted institution would know the answers to. For example, inquire about specific memories, shared experiences, or confidential details that are not easily accessible to outsiders. Pay close attention to the responses—if they seem vague, overly general, or rehearsed, this could indicate suspicious behavior. A calm demeanor allows you to think more clearly, avoid emotional reactions, and better assess the credibility of the other party.
